## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

1. **Database Setup**: Ensure you have a test database configured
   ```bash
   # Set up test database URL in your .env file
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/saaskit_test"
   ```

2. **Database Migration**: Run Prisma migrations on test database
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all integration tests
npx vitest run tests/integration --config tests/integration/vitest.config.ts

# Run specific test file
npx vitest run tests/integration/onboarding-multi-tenancy.test.ts --config tests/integration/vitest.config.ts

### Test Environment Variables

The tests use the following environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string for test database
- Other environment variables from your `.env` file may be needed for full functionality

## Test Utilities

### `TestUtils` Class
- `createTestUser()`: Creates a test user with unique identifiers
- `cleanupUser()`: Properly cleans up user and related data
- `cleanupOrganization()`: Cleans up organization and related data
- `generateUniqueSlug()`: Generates unique slugs for organizations
- `generateUniqueEmail()`: Generates unique test emails

### `DatabaseHelpers` Class
- `getOrganizationWithMembers()`: Fetches organization with member details
- `getUserWithOrganizations()`: Fetches user with organization memberships
- `getProjectsByOrganization()`: Fetches projects for a specific organization
- `countUserOrganizations()`: Counts active organizations for a user
- `countOrganizationProjects()`: Counts projects in an organization

## Test Data Management

The tests automatically:
- Create unique test data for each test case
- Clean up all test data after each test
- Handle foreign key constraints properly
- Prevent test data pollution between test runs

## Debugging Tests

If tests fail:

1. **Check Database Connection**: Ensure your test database is running and accessible
2. **Verify Migrations**: Make sure all Prisma migrations are applied
3. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure all required env vars are set
4. **Review Test Output**: Tests provide detailed error messages for debugging

## Adding New Tests

When adding new integration tests:

1. Use the existing `TestUtils` and `DatabaseHelpers` for consistency
2. Always clean up test data in `afterEach` hooks
3. Use unique identifiers to prevent test conflicts
4. Follow the existing naming conventions
5. Add appropriate documentation for new test scenarios
